# Azure Search Services 

This is based on the Azure-Samples/search-java-getting-started, changed/added the following:
* Gradleized it....
* Removed the App.java and moved the methods in the Test FW
* Changed System.out into Logger stuff
* Added TestNG testCases...so you can run and test and change your expectations
* Just change the following PARAMS in the code:
  * SERVICE_NAME = "YOUR SERVICE NAME, just the name not the domain extension!!!";
  * API_KEY = "YOUR API KEY";

Goal was to make learning Azure Search more accessible, just run gradle test
